# Buy a Commercial License

*Ready to scale your JSON Schema management? Our commercial licensing ensures
you have the tools and support needed for enterprise deployments while
contributing to the continued development of industry-leading JSON Schema
technology.*

Sourcemeta One is [publicly available on
GitHub](https://github.com/sourcemeta/one) with full source code transparency,
enabling comprehensive auditing and community contributions.  While the
codebase is accessible for review and collaboration, Sourcemeta One operates
under a [source-available
license](https://github.com/sourcemeta/one/blob/main/LICENSE) rather than a
traditional open-source model.

## Editions

You can use the Sourcemeta One commercial edition at no cost with all features
included for non-commercial and evaluation purposes. However, commercial
deployments require a license from Sourcemeta. This licensing model enables us
to:

- Maintain and enhance the service's advanced capabilities
- Provide enterprise-grade support and reliability
- Continue investing in cutting-edge JSON Schema tooling development

## Our Commitment to Excellence

Sourcemeta is led by a member of the JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee,
ensuring our solutions meet the highest industry standards and remain aligned
with JSON Schema ecosystem developments. As an independent, bootstrapped
company without venture capital backing, we maintain complete focus on
delivering nothing less than exceptional JSON Schema tooling.
